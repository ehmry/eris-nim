; ERIS consumers observe blocks by reference and
; ERIS stores reply by asserting block content.
ErisBlock = <erisx3 @reference bytes @content bytes> .

; ERIS producers put blocks to storage by publishing
; blocks and observing cache assertions matching
; block references. ERIS stores respond by storing
; blocks and asserting the reference and an (as yet arbitrary)
; indicator of cache presistence.
ErisCache = <erisx3-cache @reference bytes @persist int> .
