# â¯° ERIS

A collection of libraries and utilities for the [Encoding for Robust Immutable Storage](https://eris.codeberg.page).

The latest version of this repository should be available at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/eris/nim-eris).

## Building

### Debian

The Debian is too old and crusty to build this. It must be hard for them recruit new maintainers.

Some step that you will need to waste your time on:

- Build and install the current Nim compiler and the Nimble utility
- Install pkg-config
- Build and install the [tkrzw library](https://dbmx.net/tkrzw/) from source
- Build and install the [getdns library](https://getdnsapi.net/) from source
- Run `nimble install https://codeberg.org/eris/nim-eris.git`

## eriscmd

`eriscmd` is a utility program with a bunch of subcommands. They should be self describing except for `resolver`.

### resolver

The `eris resolver` utility that resolves ERIS blocks between the following:
  - [CoAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Application_Protocol) clients
  - CoAP servers
  - HTTP clients (see [ERIS over HTTP](https://eris.codeberg.page/eer/eer-001/))
  - HTTP servers
  - [tkrzw](https://dbmx.net/tkrzw/) database files
  - [Syndicate](https://syndicate-lang.org) [actors](./protocols/syndicate_protocol.prs)

The server configuration is inspired by [Genode](https://genode.org/)'s [dynamic component reconfiguration](https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/21.05/components/Component_configuration.html) and implemented by the Syndicated actor model. The server cannot be excuted normally, it must be supervised by a [Syndicate server](https://synit.org/book/operation/system-bus.html). The configuration schema is at [erisresolver_config.prs](./protocols/erisresolver_config.prs) and sample is at [erisresolver.config.sample.pr](./erisresolver.config.sample.pr).

If you are using UNIX you will need to ask a system administrator or a grownup that you trust to remove the restriction on binding to port 80. This is can be done with `sysctl`:
```sh
doas sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
```

## Nix development

```sh
nix develop git+https://codeberg.org/eris/nix-eris#nim-eris
```
